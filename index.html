      Description of Competition:
    </h5>
    <p>
      Theyâ€™re the top two YouTube channels in terms of subscriber count. They are completely different in what they post. T-Series is 
      basically Bollywood everything, run by a massive Indian corporation and PewDiePie is kind of a meme channel run by a single 
      Swedish guy and a few editors. There is a very heated competition to see who reaches 100 million subscribers first that has 
      been going since August 2018. This competition represents the battle between large corporations and the individual. T-Series is a 
      corporation, whereas PewDiePie is an individual. If PewDiePie gets to 100 million first, then we can collectively tell YouTube that 
      individual creators still matter, and that the platform will not be sold to giant, politically correct corporations.
